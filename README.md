# ocsilostor
This is oscilostor, one part of my thesis project

Oscilostor is a great portable system with a cross-patform desktop application to measure voltage and current signals and generate real-time graphs and find resistance, capacitance, and inductance values. The whole package together is a cheap option for educational purposes.

Both hardware and software sides of this project was by me.

Altium designer board design, micro controller code, and Qt/C++ application codes are available above.
